Welcome to the GANG jobs board.

Please create an issue in the [issues tab](https://github.com/gangannounce/jobs/issues).

And please add information about:

- job description
- salary range
- contact method

---

## For employer:

Welcome! Come to the [issues tab](https://github.com/gangannounce/jobs/issues) to create a new talent issue.

It is expected that a salary range is annotated to allow viewers to estimate the degree of functional level required.

Additionally, if another label is required then please open an issue.

## For employee:

The GitHub issues system has a very convenient label and filter that can be used together. 
For example, to filter the list of job titles updated from 2018-07-01, use the following filter with

    is:open updated:>2015-07-01
    https://github.com/gangannounce/jobs/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen+updated%3A%3E2018-07-01
